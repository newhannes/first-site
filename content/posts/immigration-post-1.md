Starting *In the Data's Own Words* off gently with the non-topical issue of immigration. I didn't want to jump into something controversial right out the gate. Ha. 

This is the first of what I believe will be several posts reviewing chapters from the book I am currently reading, *Good Economics for Hard times* by Banerjee and Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates). The pair of economists explore hot-button issues such as immigration, trade, and climate change, presenting the economic literature's consensus on the topic and pointing out flaws in the layman's view (as well as flaws in the expert opinion). I will summarize their arguments, explore the data on my own, and respond to Banerjee and Duflo's exposition. This post will review the first half of their chapter on immigration. A second post will cover the rest of the chapter and include a section exploring the current state of immigration in the United States. 

### In Banerjee and Duflo's Words
Banerjee and Duflo begin their discussion by explaining its relevance. Suprisingly, the authors note that immigration is not an especially pertinent topic due to some large increase in immigration but because of "recent alarmism" in the public that has been stoked by politicians worldwide. The percentage of international migrants globally in 2017 was roughly the same as it was in 1960 or 1990. However, the authors reference several surveys which show how citizens of a nation repeatedly overestimate the level of immigration their country is experiencing. Banerjee and Duflo argue the fears behind these overestimates and the arguments made by isolationist politicians are not supported by data nor economic theory. 

1. Who moves?
Not many, apparantly! 

2. Effect on native wages and unemployment
