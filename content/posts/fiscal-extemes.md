A brief aside (mostly to myself) before jumping into this topic. I can struggle to reach the finishline on some projects. Often, the reason for this is because I continue to push the finishline further away, striving for perfection. In this blog, I want to push back against this tendency. I am not going to be able to fully address issues like immigration, trade, vaccines, and our nation's impending fiscal crisis in a blog post. Instead, I will just keep producing content. In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear makes an argument for quantity over quality. He notes that it if you continue to output products (whatever that may look like), you are bound to hit gold in some of them. Rather then spending excessive time on one project, keep things moving and your quality will improve as you produce. That is the strategy I am bringing to *In the Data's Own Words*. I feel especially pressured to make this first post a fully comprehensive, no-stone-unturned, production but will instead rip the bandaid off and let the words flow. So, with the caveat that this post is woefully inadequate but such inadequacies will be addressed in my future work, let's look at the fiscal course of our nation!

#### Introduction

The national debt is not a very approachable topic for most Americans. Thanksgiving political discussions would be about as dry as the holdiday's talisman dish (turkey is just not good folks) if family members only debated the accumulation of gross national debt in our nation's history. While the reasons behind this accumulation are more likely to cause sparks, to the average discusser the impact of $36 trillion in debt is less interesting fare. Apparently, a majority of voters are concerned about the debt, with the Peterson Institute [finding](https://www.pgpf.org/press/2025-04-fci-press-release/) 75 percent of voters think addressing the debt should be a top-three priority for the president and Congress. I have some doubts on this conviction however and am going to continue with this blog post.

There are multiple reasons for why the national debt is not as charged of an issue as immigration, abortion, higher education, or welfare. I will attempt to address some of these reasons in this forthcoming series on our nation's fiscal extremes. This first post will address two reasons I believe the topic isn't as debated as it should be. First, people do not have a reference level for what $36 trillion in debt means. Second, people do not understand that this debt is the result of a trajectory -- and a trajectory that worsens as we look into the future. The following sections will explore the historical and projected data for three metrics: deficits, gross national debt, and gross debt as a percentage of our nation's economy. 

#### Deficits

You can't have debt without deficits. So our exploration will begin here. A deficit is incurred when spending exceeds revenue. In the government's case, this occurs when the tax revenues from individuals and corporations are insufficient to cover expenditures (aka outlays) on federal programs. A future post will look into this mismatch in more detail but for now we will just look at the result of this imbalance. The figure below depicts historical federal deficits since 1980 and projected deficits from the Congressional Budget Office all the way to 2055. The data are recorded for fiscal years (a fiscal year runs October - September, so fiscal year 2024 ended September 30th, 2024).

It should be noted that the above chart depicts both surpluses and deficits ran by the federal government in the past 45 years. Looking at the historical data, we see that these surpluses are hard to find. Of these 45 years, only four saw revenues exceed outlays: 1998-2001. The reasons for these surpluses are complex but the broad explanation is simple. Surpluses are generated by a combination of economic growth, increases in tax revenues, and decreases in outlays. While understanding these factors in achieving the 1998-2001 surpluses would take too long for this post, I will make note of each factor briefly. First, the 1990s experienced robust economic growth fueled by global trade, demographic factors (Baby-Boomers in prime working age), and, most importantly, an information-technology boom that accelerated worker productivity. Following the 1991 recession, the economy expanded in the rest of the decade, averaging a healthy 4.3 percent annual growth in the 1996-2000 period. As the economy grows, revenues increase from higher corporate and individual incomes. Additionally, economic growth lifts lower-income individuals off welfare rolls (reducing outlays for those programs) and reduces the political pressure for increased spending as unemployment is kept low. Secondly, early in his first term, President Clinton signed tax increases into law in 1993. Finally, spending decreased as a result of before-mentioned factors as well as legislation from Congress which established and enforced spending caps and offsets. Falling defense spending following the end of the Cold War also contributed. 

Inheriting the Clinton surplus, President Bush believed this abundance should be returned to the American people, reducing taxes in both 2001 and 2003. Deficits return but remain manageable, even declining in 2006 and 2007 as President Bush scaled back his fiscal expansion. Growing economic woes lead to a reversal of this restraint, with a stimulus package signed by President Bush in early 2008. The deficit grew by nearly $300 billion in 2008 to $459 billion, nearly triple the 2007 deficit. Legislation responding to the financial crisis of 08-09 ratchet deficits skyward. In 2009, the deficit soared to $1.4 trillion, a 208 percent increase from 2008.     

Deficits slowly decline, reaching a trough of $442 billion in 2015. However, this low point exceeds the peak of the previous, pre-crisis cycle in 2004 which was $413 billion. This reveals an important phenomenon that persists even when accounting for inflation. Policymakers are unable or unwilling to return to pre-crisis levels of spending. The responses to these crises are not merely a one-time hit to our fiscal health but up the ante, elevating the baseline level to a new, more dangerous height. 

This is especially true of the last five years. Deficits grow somewhat steadily following 2015 but reach a record high $3.1 trillion in 2020 (a 218 percent increase from FY2019) as fiscal stimulus responding to the covid pandemic pours out of D.C. The recession following the epidemic was deep but short. Half of all job losses were recovered by fall 2020. All jobs were recovered by early 2022. Despite this short recovery, federal dollars continued to proliferate. This caused inflation and continued elevated deficits. 

For this fiscal year (FY2025), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congress's budget watchdog, projects the deficit will reach $1.9 trillion. This would be the third highest deficit in our nation's history. I am not sure what crisis has warranted this figure. We have finished our brief dive into history and now look out from our (much) elevated position at the picture before us. Here we can see the nature of this beast and find a reason to care about our deficits: they just keep growing. Admittedly, this still is not sufficient reason to care, as we have yet to discuss exactly why these deficits are a problem. However, we can see from the right side of our chart that CBO projects these deficits to continue to rise, reaching an incomprehensible $6.4 trillion by 2055. These projections are under current-law assumptions that extend enacted legislation to 2055. Following what is currently on the books, means CBO accounts for the 2017 tax cuts to expire at the end of this year, which explains the decrease in the deficit in 2026 and 2027. 

This section was mostly a historical trip through the past 40 or so years of federal deficits. Our main insight from the data is that these deficits are persistent and worsening. That information is insufficient to be fully alarming but should be enough to make you feel uneasy. We have a massive beast here and lack the ability or will to seriously approach the creature. 

#### Debt
<!--- talk about interest payments -->
What do those deficits do? They accumulate into debt. This section will briefly trace the history of our national debt then discuss why this accumulation is an issue. 

![images](/images/federal-budget/debt.svg)

The gross national debt reached $1 trillion in 1982. Twenty-six years later it hit $10 trillion in 2008. The next milestone, $20 trillion, was met nine years later in 2017. Reaching $30 trillion in 2022 took five years. CBO projects the $40 trillion milestone will be hit in 2027, another five year window but one that is not expected to include a global pandemic. Long story short: debt milestones are coming at an increasing rate. 

It is about time I started offering some more comprehensive reasons for why you should care about debt and deficits. This topic is worthy of a standalone post but I will briefly go through three broad reasons.

1. Stymies economic growth

When the government spends more than it collects, it must borrow the cash to cover that deficit. It does so by issuing debt through the Treasury and selling that debt to domestic and foreign investors. These investors exchange dollars for Treasury securities, choosing the risk-free income promised by government debt. This process reduces investment in the economy, harming long-term growth. Resources that would go to growing the capital stock are instead used to fund government expenditures. Businesses choose government debt over building a new factory. CBO analysis [found](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45140) that for every dollar increase in the federal deficit, private investment decreases by 33 cents. As large deficits persist, the government requires more and more buyers for its debt. To lure more buyers, it must offer a higher interest rate. This higher rate increases the attractiveness of government debt relative to other investments and further drags down growth.     

2. Rising interest costs steal more budget resources

How much does the govenment pay these lenders? If you haven't though about it before, give it a guess. How much will net interest cost the federal government in 2025? On $36 tillion gross debt, the US will pay **$952 billion** on interest for fiscal year 2025. Just a rounding estimate away from one trillion dollars. As of April 2025, this number [exceeds](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#297323da3d78) the net worth of the four wealthiest people on the planet. It is also greater than all defense spending for 2025 ($859 billion) and only behind Social Security as the second largest singular item in the federal budget. This absurdly large number is not spent on benefits for the vulnerable or to improve infrastructure but rather sends taxpayer dollars into the void. As large deficits persist, the interest rate the government pays rises, driving interest costs higher thereby worsening the deficit and creating a perilious downward spiral. 

More generally, running elevated deficits in time of relative peace and prosperity mean when the crises do come, policymakers are more limited in their ability to respond. With a strained federal budget, adding trillions of dollars in federal stimulus becomes a signifcantly more dangerous task. In this scenario, interest rates would be high, making the debt incurred by the jump in federal spending send interest costs through the roof. Additionally, a large accumulation of debt in previous years means that when the crisis comes and rates shoot upward with the spike in outlays, rolling over the previous debt (issuing new debt to replace old debt) will become substantially more expensive. Further, investors would largely have their fill of government debt, meaning Congress be even more reliant on the mercy of the Federal Reserve to finance its stimulus as the lender of last resort. The resulting inflation as the central bank monetized (printed money to purchase government debt) this spending would be hugely painful. 

3. Burdens future generations 

There is a minority opinion among some economists that the debt is insignificant because it is money we ["owe to ourselves."](https://x.com/paulkrugman/status/1180457374705999872). The idea here is that any liability a taxpayer has for the national debt is directly offset by the holding of that debt as an asset. So the government's liabilities are the public's assets. Drawing from 20th century Nobel laureate James Buchnanan, a simple depiction proves the error in this logic. A person, Lender, gives $100 to another individual, Borrower, who spends the money on personal consumption. Lender will be down $100, but recieves an IOU from Borrower for this $100. Borrower incurs a $100 liability but, because of how he spent this money, he does not have any offsetting assets. Now imagine the two get married, combining their finances. Lender's recieved IOU and Borrower's liability cancel out, making the debt vanish. The problem is that the $100 dollars has also vanished. As a couple, the two are down $100 in wealth.
