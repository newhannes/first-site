A brief aside (mostly to myself) before jumping into this topic. I can struggle to reach the finishline on some projects. Often, the reason for this is because I continue to push the finishline further away, striving for perfection. In this blog, I want to push back against this tendency. I am not going to be able to fully address issues like immigration, trade, vaccines, and our nation's impending fiscal crisis in a blog post. Instead, I will just keep producing content. In *Atomic Habits*, James Clear makes an argument for quantity over quality. He notes that it if you continue to output products (whatever that may look like), you are bound to hit gold in some of them. Rather then spending excessive time on one project, keep things moving and your quality will improve as you produce. That is the strategy I am bringing to *In the Data's Own Words*. I feel especially pressured to make this first post a fully comprehensive, no-stone-unturned, production but will instead rip the bandaid off and let the words flow. So, with the caveat that this post is woefully inadequate but such inadequacies will be addressed in my future work, let's look at the fiscal course of our nation!

#### Introduction

The national debt is not a very approachable topic for most Americans. Thanksgiving political discussions would be about as dry as the holdiday's talisman dish (turkey is just not good folks) if family members only debated the accumulation of gross national debt in our nation's history. While the reasons behind this accumulation are more likely to cause sparks, to the average discusser the impact of $36 trillion in debt is less interesting fare. There are multiple reasons for why the national debt is not as charged of an issue as immigration, abortion, higher education, or welfare. I will attempt to address some of these reasons in this forthcoming series on our nation's fiscal extremes. This first post will address two reasons I believe the topic isn't as debated as it should be. First, people do not have a reference level for what $36 trillion in debt means. Second, people do not understand that this debt is the result of a trajectory -- and a trajectory that worsens as we look into the future. The following sections will explore the historical and projected data for three metrics: deficits, gross national debt, and gross debt as a percentage of our nation's economy. 

#### Deficits

You can't have debt without deficits. So our exploration will begin here. A deficit is incurred when spending exceeds revenue. In the government's case, this occurs when the tax revenues from individuals and corporations are insufficient to cover expenditures on federal programs. A future post will look into this mismatch in more detail but for now we will just look at the result of this imbalance. The figure below depicts historical federal deficits since 1980 and projected deficits from the Congressional Budget Office all the way to 2055. The data are recorded for fiscal years (a fiscal year runs October - September, so fiscal year 2024 ended September 30th, 2024).
