      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my second post. It is not in the content/posts folder. It is just in the content folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason the local server is not updating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; text. This is &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First post yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I edit here will it show up on the localhost server? It does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the server still show an Introduciton header?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Drew Sikkink. I started this blog because I missed making my own arguments. While I cannot make these arguments without the research and opinions of those more knowledgable than me, my understanding of issues has suffered because all I do is read and listen. Without engaging topics with my own words and thoughts, I cannot truly understand the problem. Enter &amp;ldquo;In the Data&amp;rsquo;s Own Words.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This name was inspired by a quote from Ronald Coase, a British economist who won the Nobel prize in 1991. Coase cautioned against approaching the data with previously established biases and hacking away at anaylses until the theory was confirmed. In his own words: &amp;ldquo;if you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.&amp;rdquo; His actual quote may have been &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; nature will confess,&amp;rdquo; but either way the warning is clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
